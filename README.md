URL shortener powered by GitHub pages & repos

Proof of concept URL shortener with no back-end servers (apart from GitHub's!).

Create an issue on the [ghurl/db](https://github.com/ghurl/db/issues) repository.
The **title** of the issue should be the URL you want to redirect to.

Then, construct your shortened URL using **n**, the issue number:
`https://ghurl.github.io/?n`
